 Hi, thereðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my Github. My name is Bong-oh, Moon from South Korea. I am studying undergraduate of Software Engineering at Jeonbuk National University in South Korea. I like to study overall software technology, framework and computer science. I love PS(Problem Solving)!
 
 I understand the software development process well and like to focus on separating the interests of the design/development process and implementing the service from the user's perspective when I'm working on a project.
 
 I was able to broaden my horizons and get various motifs by experiencing technologies and implementing services in many projects. I have been dealing with Mobile/Web Front-end (ex. React Native, React, Vue) and Back-end(ex. Spring) a lot these days, and I want to get a chance to learn and grow myself more through this opportunity.

<!-- Currently, I'm interested in web or application development, especially front-end development such as React or React Native.  -->

### ðŸ”­ I'm Currently interested in

- Computer Science, especially OS, Algorithms
